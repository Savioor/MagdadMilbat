# Deep Exhalation - A Magdad Project

Deep Exhalation ('נשיפה עמוקה') is an application written in Java in collaboration with a non-profit organization in order to assist people with disabilities. The application consists of two main modules; image recognition and processing and application development (e.g. the backend and the frontend).

## Backend
The code in the backend is written using the OpenCV library for Android. Given the frames of the phone camera, the code processes them and finds the three colored balls and their position.

An example for an image it recieves may be:
